# Planning for security controls

# Goal
Objective of this project is to protect, detect, and respond to possible threats to the security of the organization’s mission COMPANY_A. Founded in 2010, COMPANY_A develops and sells
the famous “Beeplepop” along with a line of household innovations that forever revolutionized the way we live and work. COMPANY_A’s main office is located at an office park in St. Louis,
MO, and accommodates approximately 100 full-time employees. The office park is home to 3-4 similarly sized companies with shared parking facilities.

# Instructions

## Phase 1: The environment
 Review how well COMPANY_A’s current security controls hold-up against the NIST-800-53 framework.
 Make potential recommendations to add or enhance physical, administrative, and logical controls used by COMPANY_A. 

## Phase 2: Security design
Due to the global pandemic, the World Health Organization declares a global health emergency. Many countries order an immediate lockdown of industrial and commercial facilities, travel
bans have been declared. March 13, 2020 the US declares a national emergency, issues guidelines to slow the spread.
The technology team has been scrambling to inventory and distribute computing resources for all staff. Under the current network topology, employees will not be able to access the
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is currently located in the on-premise datacenter. 
We have recommended implementing a VPN gateway as a quick, low-cost solution to provide access to resources behind COMPANY_A's firewall. We need to ceate a deployment plan to
incorporate this new VPN functionality into the network topology. We will be using OpenVPN wit DUO 2FA.
